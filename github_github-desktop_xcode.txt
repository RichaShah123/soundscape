When first getting started with GitHub, the learning curve can feel a bit steep â€” especially if you're new to version control or haven't used tools like Git before. Concepts like repositories, commits, branches, and pushing to remote can be unfamiliar, and even basic actions like uploading a file or making a commit might seem intimidating at first. The GitHub website provides a relatively user-friendly interface, but without a graphical tool or terminal experience, managing code changes can feel a little abstract. It's normal to run into a few roadblocks early on, especially when you're trying to figure out how everything fits together.

Thankfully, I had an amazing support system around me. Tim and the rest of the team were incredibly helpful in explaining how to use GitHub effectively. Tim especially went out of his way to help me get set up on GitHub Desktop, walking me through the basics of how to manage repositories, track changes, and push commits. Having someone guide me through the initial setup made a huge difference and helped me gain confidence quickly. Once I understood how to drag files into the repo folder, write commit messages, and sync with GitHub.com, it all started to click. Over time, using GitHub became second nature, and the initial confusion gave way to a sense of control and clarity. The whole process, which once felt overwhelming, now feels much more manageable. It just took time, and help from my team. Learning to commit confidently was a big milestone, and having the team's support made that journey so much smoother.
