I chose Soundscape as my project for this semester because I found it to be very inspiring and meaningful. The idea of creating a tool that helps people, especially those who are blind or visually impaired, navigate their surroundings using sound felt like more than just a technical challenge. It felt like a project with purpose. Soundscape stood out to me because it wasn't just about building something cool or impressive. It was about solving a real problem in the world and making a difference in someone's day-to-day life. I really appreciated how it blended technology and empathy, showing how thoughtful design can open up possibilities for people who are often overlooked by mainstream tech.

As I worked on the project, I realized just how impactful even small innovations can be when theyâ€™re guided by accessibility and inclusivity. The concept of using spatial audio cues to provide directional feedback was both fascinating and practical. It challenged me to think beyond traditional user interfaces and consider how people interact with technology in different ways. I also learned the importance of user testing and feedback in creating something that truly works for the intended audience.
