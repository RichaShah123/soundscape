Working with Parsec was a bit of a learning experience, especially as someone who wasn’t directly involved in setting up the machines but still had to use them regularly for development. The general process started with downloading the Parsec app, logging in with the shared team credentials (we had a Soundscape gmail that everyone had access to), and requesting access to one of the Macs set up for the project. Once I submitted the access request, the Soundscape gmail would get an email requesting to grant me permission to connect. From there, I could simply hit the "Connect" button under the Mac I’d been granted access to, and I’d be in. No additional setup was needed beyond that initial step, which made it pretty smooth once everything was running properly.

There were definitely a few quirks I had to learn along the way. For instance, we quickly realized the importance of creating our own folders under the “Documents” tab in Finder to avoid overwriting each other’s work—especially when multiple people were editing files in the same environment. There was also a specific setting in Parsec I had to change: under the host tab in the settings menu, I had to disable hosting mode on my personal client to prevent visibility issues across machines. One unexpected obstacle was that logging out of the Mac (rather than just locking the screen) would disrupt Parsec access entirely, so we had to be careful to leave the session running or simply lock the screen if we needed to step away. We all made mistakes early on, like accidentally logging each other out or forgetting to close open windows, but once we figured out a rhythm and started communicating more consistently, things ran a lot more smoothly.
